Hello!

These are all of the notes that I have for CS246. I took them during Nomair Naeem's 8:30am Tuesday and Thursday morning lectures every day, except for a couple days where I was sick and had to ask for notes. I try to type everything important the prof says and write down everything he writes on the board, even if that means replicating stack diagrams in ASCII :P

The accumulatedLectures file is all of the lecture and tutorial notes concatenated together. This file is especially useful if you are studying for an exam and want to grep the entire course for a specific concept.

I type quickly in class and often make typos, but can't catch them all on my own. Feel free to let me know if you spot one! Pull requests are welcome :)
